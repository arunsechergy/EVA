Dataset explanation

The input dataset size has 3590 images, with focus on hardhat workers and safety vest


Monocular depth estimation relies on large and diverse training sets. 
Due to the challenges associated with acquiring dense ground-truth depth across different environments at scale, 
a number of datasets with distinct characteristics and biases was created. The given dataset has variety of scenes and 
properties in the scene.
